<h1>Bio</h1>
  <p>My name is Adam Mudd.  For the past 10 years, I have taught High School Social Studies classes.  While I loved my time as a teacher, I have decided to persue a new career in Web Development.  </p>
  <p>My experiences with web development started by taking a highschool class in HTML 2.  Since then, I participated in Code Louisivlle, from which I should graduate in three weeks.  I am interested in continuing my learning, and learning more back end languages in the future.</p>
  <p>You will find a number of projects I have put together in order to test my skills on this page.  Most of them were desgined in order to solve a problem I have encountered in life, or in my various nerdy hobbies.  If you would like to contact me, don't hestitate to reach out on one of the sites listed above. Thanks for visiting.</p>
